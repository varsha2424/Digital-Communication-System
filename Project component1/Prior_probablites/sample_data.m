Artificial intelligence AI is intelligence demonstrated by machines unlike the natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals Leading AI textbooks define the field as the study of intelligent agents any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals3 Colloquially the term artificial intelligence is often used to describe machines or computers that mimic cognitive functions that humans associate with the human mind such as learning and problem solving4

As machines become increasingly capable tasks considered to require intelligence are often removed from the definition of AI a phenomenon known as the AI effect5 A quip in Teslers Theorem says AI is whatever hasnt been done yet6 For instance optical character recognition is frequently excluded from things considered to be AI7 having become a routine technology8 Modern machine capabilities generally classified as AI include successfully understanding human speech9 competing at the highest level in strategic game systems such as chess and Go10 autonomously operating cars intelligent routing in content delivery networks and military simulations11

Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1955 and in the years since has experienced several waves of optimism1213 followed by disappointment and the loss of funding known as an AI winter1415 followed by new approaches success and renewed funding1316 For most of its history AI research has been divided into subfields that often fail to communicate with each other17 These subfields are based on technical considerations such as particular goals eg robotics or machine learning18 the use of particular tools logic or artificial neural networks or deep philosophical differences212223 Subfields have also been based on social factors particular institutions or the work of particular researchers17

The traditional problems or goals of AI research include reasoning knowledge representation planning learning natural language processing perception and the ability to move and manipulate objects18 General intelligence is among the fields longterm goals24 Approaches include statistical methods computational intelligence and traditional symbolic AI Many tools are used in AI including versions of search and mathematical optimization artificial neural networks and methods based on statistics probability and economics The AI field draws upon computer science information engineering mathematics psychology linguistics philosophy and many other fields
